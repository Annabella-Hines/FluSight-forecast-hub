methods: "Seasonal ARIMA model with exogenous covariates for cumulative vaccination coverage, seasonal vaccine effectiveness, weekly A/H3N2 circulation, and influenza transmissability (weekly effective reproduction numbers)."
data_inputs: "Forecasts use HHS influenza hospitalization data, CDC FluSurv-NET hospitalization rates, syndromic and virologic surveillance data from CDC FluView, vaccination coverage estimates from the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, and seasonal vaccine effectiveness estimates from published observational studies and the CDC."
methods_long: "We use dynamic regression models with ARIMA errors and exogenous covariates for seasonal cumulative vaccination coverage, seasonal vaccine effectiveness, weekly A/H3N2 circulation, and weekly influenza infections. We used historical data on influenza hospitalizations (incidence, epidemic size, and timing), influenza-like illness rates, influenza A subtype circulation, and vaccine coverage and effectiveness to calibrate our model. As a proxy for influenza transmission intensity, we include weekly effective reproduction number as a covariate in our models. For seasons 2010-2011 to 2019-2020, we estimated weekly influenza-like illness x percent positive values (for any flu type/subtype) using influenza syndromic and virological surveillance data provided by the CDC FluView portal. To estimate weekly Rt, we fit semi-mechanistic Bayesian epidemiological models to observed ILI x % positive rates during each season, assuming a case ascertainment rate of 0.3.."
